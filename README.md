# Audio-Sentimental-Analysis
The Audio Sentiment Analysis project uses Python and machine learning to detect emotions from speech. By training on labeled audio datasets, it extracts features like MFCCs to classify tones such as happy, sad, or angry. Built with Librosa, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, it delivers accurate emotion prediction from voice data.
